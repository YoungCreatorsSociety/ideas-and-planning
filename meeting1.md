#Meeting 1

##Tumblr vs. Ghost
 - We need to make a decision soon
 - Samuel can help Mike with setting up Node/nginx, and Ghost's default theme is loads better than Tumblr's already.
 - Eoin also mentioned that we'd be learning a lot more (one of the goals of the project) if we were to use Ghost over Tumblr

###Pros and Cons:
 - Ghost:
  - Open-source
  - Base theme is already excellent
  - Small learning curve
  - Easily customizable
  - Well-designed themes, most of which are free, but prices range up to $25 USD
  - Runs on node
  - Can be setup for multi-user usage, and users don't have to have Ghost accounts

 - Tumblr:
  - Familiar
  - Many themes, but most aren't what we're looking for (i.e. well-designed)
  - Themes can range in price to over $50 USD
  - Supports multi-user out of the box (but users have to have Tumblr accounts)
