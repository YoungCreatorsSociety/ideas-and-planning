Ideas and Planning
==================
Where Dreams are made.

Actual discussion of ideas will take place on [Slack](https://youngdesigners.slack.com) but we still need a **record keeper** for everything we have **already discussed**.

### Why Should I Use It?

The wiki will be a source of truth for our community. It will allow us to have some place to refer to information on ideas, features, implementation, etc. of the site in an organized but easily accessible(for collaboration) fashion. **It will also be extremely useful for members entering a discussion for the first time** -- this way they don't have search through past chat history or have the idea rehashed by someone in the channel.

### What Should I Use This For?

Use this wiki to record the following:

* **Ideas that have found consensus** -- You or your team have agreed on a feature, implementation method, or any other aspect of the project.
* **Ideas in discussion** -- For ideas currently being debated. Did your team take a break in discussion? Record the latest consensus so it's easier to reference later.
* **Brainstorming for new ideas and planning** -- Have a list of ideas, a thought on a new feature, or some idea not currently written? Record it for posterity! It'll make referencing later easier.

### How Do I Use It?

For now just create a new page for each new feature, I will organize the wiki into site features and aspects in the coming days to make things more orderly. I will also create a "standard template" for each of the three above mentioned types of information as well.

Happy writing!
