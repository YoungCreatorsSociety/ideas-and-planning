#Meeting 2

##Branding
 - We want to keep it open to noobs of all ages, not just limited to students
 - Vote for logos needs to be completed ASAP
 - Compile list of goals & values so everyone knows what we're building (include survey results and https://github.com/YoungCreatorsSociety/ideas-and-planning/issues/2)

##Marketing
 - Let's go live (announce ourselves, not push the entire site) after we choose the logo and begin branding work
 - Post to Medium as well as the site blog simultaneously

##Front-end
 - Styleguide needs to be worked on after logo results are in

##Back-end
 - Start working on Ghost configuration, security, etc.

##Misc
 - WorkingOn integration should be set up by this week
 - Create CONTRIBUTING.md file so everyone knows how and in what format to contribute to the project
   - Make sure contributions and commit styles are consistent
